# Computer-science-assignments
All my assignments and projects during my 4 year college period.

GENERAL OVERVIEW:
-  Students will increase their knowledge of problem solving, specifically
in the areas of problem solving strategies and problem decomposition, modular design,
design of data structures and algorithms, and testing. Students will learn more advanced
programming techniques, including dynamic allocation and recursion. Object-oriented
programming will be introduced.

COURSE OBJECTIVES:

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
-  solve problems of moderate complexity and magnitude;
-  design solutions for such problems using classes and/or complex data structures;
-  define and explain the central aspects of structured programming;
-  design and implement programs that make effective use of structured programming
-  
concepts (specifically using the C++ programming language);
-  define and explain the central aspects of object-oriented programming
-  design and implement programs that make effective use of object-oriented
-  
programming concepts (specifically using C++);
-  develop and debug large programs in a systematic manner;
-  develop and execute a comprehensive test plan;
-  
explain the concepts of and develop programs which use:
-  pointers and dynamic memory allocation
-  linked data structures
-  recursion
-  classes and objects
-  lists, stacks, and queues

ASSIGNMNETS OVERVIEW:
-  Programming assignments will be written in C++ using the INS Linux server (ins.mtroyal.ca)
-  Assignments 1-4 are writen in C++
-  Typescript files are recorded assignment submissions
-  Each assignment folder has its "assignment specifications" containing detailed explanations and requirements about the assignment.
